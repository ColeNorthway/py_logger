BLU-PRINT

//Maybe many classes/threads
//One class will log to a global list
//Another writer class will read the list and write to a file
//Another class will actually be the timer and set a global counter for the top of the hour


1) Make a keylogger class
	> Has all of the necessary functionality to log keys
	  > Will capture keystrokes
	  DO THIS VVVV
	  > Will also determine the program that the keystrokes are happening at.
	> Will write the logs to a queue
2) Make a writer class
	> Will continue to get queue information and write to a file.
	> Will call the file manipulator's write queue and lock the file access down
	> When it recvs a signal it will exit or release the lock for the timer to then be able to overwrite and email the log file.
3) The timer class
	> The top of the hour it will send the file then overwrite it.
	> The full functionality is implemented in file manipulator class.
4) File Manipulator Class
	> Has the loop to write the queue to the file
	> Has to loop to overwrite the file
	> Has locks on both methods.
