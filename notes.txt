BLU-PRINT

//Maybe many classes/threads
//One class will log to a global list
//Another writer class will read the list and write to a file
//Another class will actually be the timer and set a global counter for the top of the hour


1) Make a keylogger class
	> Has all of the necessary functionality to log keys
	  > Will capture keystrokes
	  > Will also determine the program that the keystrokes are happening at.
	> Will write the logs to a global list
	> Will also check a global counter to see when the top of the hour is
	  > Will clear that list if that var is set.
2) Make a writer class
	> This will read from the global list and write to a file
	> Will also check for that same global counter.
	  > Will clear the file at the top of the hour.
	  > Then go back and continue reading that list and writing to that file.
3) The timer class
	> Will literally just set a global variable at the top of the hour and then unset it after like 20 seconds or something to give ample time for the other threads/classes to notice its set.


Imports We Need

Potential Loss
	> The keylogger class will clear the list as soon as a key is pressed.
	  > Figure out mitigation later.
