BLU-PRINT

//Maybe many classes/threads
//One class will log to a global list
//Another writer class will read the list and write to a file
//Another class will actually be the timer and set a global counter for the top of the hour


1) Make a keylogger class
	> Has all of the necessary functionality to log keys
	  > Will capture keystrokes
	  > Will also determine the program that the keystrokes are happening at.
	> Will write the logs to a global list
	> Will also check a global counter to see when the writer class finished reading from its list.
	  > Will clear that list if that var is set.
2) Make a writer class
	> This will write to a file.
	> Will continue to get queue information and write to a file.
	> Will pause when the timer hits top of hour to let the timer clear our the file
3) The timer class
	> This will set a global varaible to let the writer to know to stop writing
	  > Then reset the variable when the file is overwritten
	> This will hit the top of the hour then send a copy of the file to an email


Imports We Need

Potential Loss
	> The keylogger class will clear the list as soon as a key is pressed.
	  > Figure out mitigation later.
